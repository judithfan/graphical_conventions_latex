\begin{abstract}
Drawing is a versatile technique for visual communication, ranging between photorealistic rendering from observation and schematic diagrams consisting entirely of symbols. 
How does a medium spanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning?
A natural possibility is that drawings derive meaning from both their visual properties as well as shared knowledge between people who use them to communicate. 
Here we evaluate this possibility by investigating how the accumulation of shared knowledge via extended visual communication between two people influences the drawings they produce and how well they communicate. 
We developed a drawing-based reference game in which two participants repeatedly communicated about visual objects. 
Across a series of controlled experiments, we found that pairs discover increasingly sparse yet effective ways of depicting them. 
These gains were specific to those objects that were repeatedly referenced, and went beyond what could be explained by task practice or the visual properties of the drawings alone. 
We employed modern techniques from computer vision to characterize how the high-level visual features of drawings changed, finding that drawings of the same object became more consistent within a pair and divergent across different pairs.
Taken together, these findings suggest that visual communication promotes the emergence of depictions whose meanings are increasingly determined by shared knowledge rather than their visual properties alone.

\section{Introduction}

From ancient etchings on cave walls to modern digital displays, visual communication lies at the heart of key human innovations (e.g., mapmaking, data visualization), and forms the foundation for the cultural transmission of knowledge and higher-level reasoning. 
Perhaps the most basic and versatile technique supporting visual communication is drawing, the earliest examples of which date to at least 40,000-60,000 years ago \cite{hoffmann2018u,Aubert:2014jy}, and which has since been adapted to a broad diversity of applications, ranging from photorealistic rendering from observation to schematic diagrams consisting entirely of symbols. 

Even drawings of the same object can be highly variable \cite{quickdraw2017}.
How does a communication medium spanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning? 
On the one hand, prior work has found that semantic information in a figurative drawing, i.e., the object it represents, can be derived purely from its perceptual properties \cite{FanCommon2018}. 
On the other hand, other work has emphasized the role of socially-mediated information and context for making appropriate inferences about what even a figurative drawing represents \cite{goodman1976languages,gombrich1969art}.

How can these two perspectives be reconciled? 
Our approach is to consider the joint contributions of visual information and social context in determining how drawings derive meaning \cite{fan2018modeling,abell2009canny}, and to propose that a critical factor affecting the balance between the two may be the amount of shared knowledge between communicators. 
Specifically, we explore the hypothesis that accumulation of shared knowledge via extended visual communication may promote the development of increasingly schematic yet effective ways of depicting a physical object, even as these \textit{ad hoc} graphical conventions may be less readily apprehended by others who lack this shared knowledge. 

To investigate this, we used an online drawing-based reference game in which two players repeatedly communicate about visual objects, and examined both how their task performance and the drawings they produced changed over time. 
Our approach was inspired by a large literature that has documented the benefits of extended interaction for facilitating communication in several modalities, including language \cite{ClarkWilkesGibbs86_ReferringCollaborative,HawkinsFrankGoodman17_ConventionFormation}, gesture \cite{goldin1996silence,fay2014creating}, and drawings \cite{garrod_foundations_2007,fay2010interactive}.

%% jefan: I want another sentence here, if possible, stating the limitations of this prior work that sets up the contributions of the current paper better.

There are three aspects of the current work that advances our prior understanding: \emph{first}, we include a control set of objects that were not repeatedly drawn, allowing us to measure the specific contribution of repeated reference; \emph{second}, we measure how strongly the visual properties of drawings drive recognition in the absence of interaction history, while equating other task variables; and \emph{third}, we employ recent advances in computational vision to quantitatively characterize changes in the high-level visual properties of drawings across repetitions. 

\section{Part I: How does repeated reference support successful visual communication?}

%% intro to this section
% \rdh{eventually need to compress these methods quite a bit (participants can be 1 sentence, much less detail about stim selection and procedure, etc.)} 

Our first goal was to understand how repeated visual communication about an object influences how they well  people communicate about that object.  
To accomplish this, we developed a drawing-based reference game for two players. 
On each trial, both players were shown a set of four objects; the sketcher’s goal was to draw one of these, the target, so that the viewer could guess the target as quickly as possible. 
The game included two sets of objects: objects in one set were drawn repeatedly, while those in a control set were drawn once at the beginning and again at the end of the game.
We hypothesized that repeated visual reference to a visual object would lead to more efficient communication about that object, relative to control objects. 

% gains in communication efficiency for all objects, they were greater for the repeated objects, suggesting both task-level and object-level benefits of repeated communication.

% Our goal was to investigate how the accumulation of shared knowledge via extended visual communication between two people influences the drawings they produce and how well they communicate. 
% Towards this end, we developed a visual communication task in which people repeatedly referred to familiar objects, but where pre-existing graphical conventions were unlikely to be sufficient to succeed. 
% In line with prior studies of repeated verbal communication \cite<e.g>{ClarkWilkesGibbs86_ReferringCollaborative} and visual communication about verbal stimuli \shortcite<e.g.>{garrod_foundations_2007}, we hypothesized that repeated visual reference to a visual object would lead to more efficient communication about that object.
% Departing from prior studies, our experiment critically includes a control set of visual objects that are not repeatedly referenced, which allows us to measure the extent to which changes in efficiency are item-specific or attributable to task practice.

\subsection{Methods: Visual Communication Experiment}

\subsubsection{Participants} 138 unique participants, who were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and grouped into 69 pairs, completed the experiment.
They were provided a base compensation of \$1.50 for participation and up to \$1.60 in bonus for high task performance.
Data from two pairs were excluded due to unusually low performance (i.e., accuracy $<$ 3 s.d. below the mean).
In this and subsequent behavioral experiments, participants provided informed consent in accordance with the Stanford IRB.\footnote{All materials and data are available at \url{https://github.com/cogtoolslab/graphical_conventions}.}

\subsubsection{Stimuli}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/task_stimuli.pdf}
\caption{Task and stimuli. } 
\label{task_stimuli}
\end{figure}

In order to make the visual communication task sufficiently challenging, we sought to construct sets of objects whose members were both geometrically complex and perceptually similar. 
To accomplish this, we employed objects from the ShapeNet database \cite{chang2015shapenet}, which contains more than 51,300 3D mesh models of real-world objects belonging to 55 different object classes.
We restricted our search to 3096 objects belonging to the \texttt{chair} class, which is among the most diverse and abundant in ShapeNet. 
To identify groups of perceptually similar chairs, we first extracted high-level visual features from 2D renderings of these 3096 instances using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, VGG-19 \cite{simonyan2014very}.   
We then applied dimensionality reduction (i.e., PCA) and $k$-means clustering on these feature vectors, yielding 70 clusters containing between 2 and 80 objects each (\red{@megsano, please verify}).
Based on these clusters, we defined 2 categories of perceptually similar objects containing 8 exemplars each (Fig.~\ref{task_stimuli}). 

\subsubsection{Task} 

%% Trial-level event structure
% Drawings were collected in the context of an online, sketching-based reference game using the framework described in \citeA{Hawkins15_RealTimeWebExperiments}. 
% The game involved two players: a \textit{sketcher} who aims to help a \textit{viewer} pick out a target object from a set of distractor objects by representing it in a sketch. 
On each trial, both participants were shown the same set of four objects; however, the positions of these objects were randomized for each participant. 
One of the four objects was highlighted on the sketcher's screen to designate it as the target.
%% Trial-level objective of sketcher and viewer
Sketchers drew using black ink on digital canvas (pen width = 5 pixels; 300 $\times$ 300 pixels) embedded in a web browser window. 
Participants drew using the mouse cursor, and were not able to delete previous strokes. 
Each stroke was rendered on the viewer's screen immediately upon the completion of each stroke.
The sketcher was instructed to take no longer than 30 seconds to produce their drawings. 
The viewer was allowed guess the identity of the drawn object by clicking one of the four objects in the array as soon as they were confident. 
Both participants received immediate feedback: the sketcher learned when and which object the viewer had clicked, and the viewer learned the true identity of the target. 
Otherwise, the viewer had no other means of communicating with the sketcher. 
Both participants earned an accuracy bonus for each correct response. 
If the correct response was made under the 30-second time limit, they also received a speed bonus inversely proportional to the time taken until the response.

%% Two conditions: repeated and control

% Each pair of participants was randomly assigned two of these categories, and only the 16 objects from these two categories appeared as drawing targets during their session.

\subsubsection{Design \& Procedure} 

Each pair of participants was randomly assigned two sets of four objects: one set was was assigned to the repeated condition; the other to the control condition.
To explore how specific the effects of repeated communication were to the repeated objects, we varied the perceptual similarity between the two sets across pairs of participants. 
In half of the pairs (N=XX pairs), the repeated set contained four randomly sampled objects from one category and the control set contained the remaining four objects from the same category. 
% These control objects were thus maximally perceptually similar to the repeated objects but were not repeatedly drawn and provided a tight baseline for object-specific effects. 
In the other half of pairs (N=XX pairs), the repeated set contained four randomly sampled objects from one category and the control set contained four randomly sampled objects from the other category.
% These control objects still shared many perceptual features with the repeated objects, but provided a measure of the more generic effects of task practice. 

% The assignment of each set to the repeated and control conditions was randomized across pairs. 

The communication task consisted of three phases. 
During the \textit{repeated} phase, the sketcher drew the four repeated objects six times each, in an interleaved order.
Within this phase were six repetition cycles wherein each repeated object served as the target exactly once, and object order was randomized across repetition cycles. 
Before and after the \textit{repeated} phase, the sketcher drew all eight objects one time each, again in randomly interleaved order. 

% Including the control condition in this pre-post design allowed us to assess the specificity of repetition effects: control objects from the same category were maximally perceptually similar to the repeated objects but were not repeatedly drawn, and control objects from the other object category provided a measure of the generic effects of production task practice. 

\subsection{Results}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/refgame_BIS_timeseries.pdf}
\caption{Communication efficiency for repeated and control objects across repetitions. Efficiency was computed using a metric that combines both speed and accuracy, and is plotted relative to the first repetition.} \label{refgame_bis}
\end{figure}

In order to measure how well pairs communicated throughout each interaction, we employed a measure of communicative efficiency \cite<the \emph{i.e., balanced integration score,}>{Liesefeld2018} that takes both accuracy (i.e., proportion of correct viewer responses) and response time (i.e., time taken to produce each drawing) into account. 
This efficiency score is computed by first z-scoring the accuracy and response time variables to map these values to the same scale and then subtracting the standardized response time from standardized accuracy. 
It is thus highest when pairs are both fast and accurate, and lowest when they make many errors and take a long time, relative to their own performance on other trials.

% ---

Because objects were randomly assigned to the repeated and control conditions, we expected no differences in task performance in the pre phase. Indeed, a linear mixed-effects model with random slopes and intercepts for each pair of participants revealed no effect of condition ($b = 0.03, ~t = 0.165, ~p = 0.869$). Moreover, we found that pairs identified the target at rates well above chance in this phase (75.7\% repeated, 76.1\% control, chance = 25\%), suggesting that they were both engaged with the task but not at ceiling performance.

To evaluate changes in communicative efficiency across each interaction, we fit our data with a linear mixed-effects model with maximal random effect structure, including random intercepts, slopes, and interactions for each pair of participants. 
We found that communicative efficiency increased overall between the \textit{pre} and \textit{post} phases ($b = 1.45,~t = 14.3,~p <0.001$), reflecting generalized improvements as a consequence of extended interaction.
Critically, this analysis also revealed a reliable interaction between phase and condition: communicative efficiency improved to a greater extent for repeated objects than control objects ($b = 0.648, ~t = 3.09,~p = 0.003$; see Figure \ref{refgame_bis}). 
These results show that there are benefits of repeatedly communicating about an object that accrue specifically to that object, suggesting the formation of object-specific graphical conventions. 
 
% the benefits of repeatedly communicating about an object accrue more strongly to that object 
% show gains in communicative efficiency are to some extent specific to the objects that were repeatedly referenced

% Optional: We found a similar pattern of results when we used the number of strokes in each sketch instead of drawing time in our estimate of communicative efficiency. 

% Thus, participants converged on simpler, faster, and more communicatively successful graphical conventions for repeated objects, which only partially transferred to other objects.

%We clearly see that while the cost of sketching decreases, the accuracy of the viewer's guess of which object the sketch is referring to increases, suggesting that this reduction is meaningful.

%% task-level and object-level benefits of extended communication. 

%Successful communication was primarily quantified as the viewer's accuracy in identifying the target. 
%The investment of time was measured as the length of time between the beginning of the first stroke to the completion of the final stroke in each sketch, and the investment of ink was measured in two ways: as the number of strokes used for each sketch and the proportion of the drawing canvas filled by ink.

%This ensures that the reduction in the drawing duration and number of strokes over time is not due to the players losing interest or becoming less motivated during the game. 

\section{Part II: What explains gains in efficiency?}

The visual communication experiment established that pairs of participants coordinate on object-specific ways of depicting objects more efficiently across repetitions.  
This raises the question: to what extent do these gains in communication efficiency reflect the accumulation of interaction-specific shared knowledge between a sketcher and viewer, as opposed to a combination of task practice and the inherent visual properties of the drawings? 
To evaluate this question, we conducted two control experiments to measure the contribution of the latter. 
In these experiments, naive participants performed a drawing recognition task in which they were presented with the final drawings from the communication experiment and guessed which of four objects it referred to. 
Their task was thus the same as the viewer's in the communication experiment, except they knew their responses were not being provided as real-time feedback to the sketcher.

% , and they made their decision based on the final drawing, rather than being able to interrupt await additional information.

\subsection{Methods: Recognition Experiment}


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/recog_BIS_timeseries.pdf}
\caption{Recognition performance in control conditions; ribbons are 95\% CIs} 
\label{recog_bis}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Participants}

245 participants recruited via AMT completed the experiment. Data from 22 participants were excluded due to low accuracy on attention-check trials (i.e., 3 or fewer correct out of 5).  

\subsubsection{Task, Design, \& Procedure}
\rdh{need sentence about attention-check trials (i.e. that a particularly recognizable drawing was inserted 5 times into every trial sequence...)}
%How does efficiency of graphical communication, measured by how accurately and quickly the viewer can select the target intended by the sketcher, change when we change the degree of interaction specificity? 
%Here, we define interaction specificity based on both temporal structure (path dependence) and partner specificity. 
%Therefore, we design several experiments that measure the recognizability of drawings and reaction times produced in the drawing task by third-party observers. 

On each trial, recognition participants were presented with a drawing paired with the same set of four objects that viewers had seen in the communication game, and guessed which object was the target. 
Just as the original viewers had been, they received an accuracy bonus for every correct response, and speed bonus inversely proportional to their response time. 
Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: a \textit{yoked} group and a \textit{shuffled} group. 
Participants in the yoked group were matched with one pair in the communication experiment and viewed 40 drawings in the same sequence the original viewer had. 
Participants in the shuffled group, on the other hand, were matched with 10 distinct pairs from the communication experiment and viewed 4 drawings from each in turn, which appeared within the same repetition cycle as they had appeared originally. 
At the trial level, both groups thus received exactly the same visual information and performed the task under the same incentives to respond quickly and accurately. 
At the session level, both groups received exactly the same amount of practice recognizing drawings.
Thus any differences between the yoked and shuffled groups are attributable to whether drawings came from the same communicative interaction, which would support the accumulation of interaction-specific shared knowledge, or from several different interactions, where such accumulation would be minimal.

We compared the yoked and shuffled groups by measuring changes in task performance on repeated objects using the same efficiency metric as we had previously. 
We estimated the magnitude of these changes by fitting a linear mixed-effects model that included group (i.e., yoked vs. shuffled), repetition number (i.e., 1st through 8th), and their interaction as fixed effects, and random intercepts and slopes for each viewer/recognition participant. 

This analysis revealed that recognition performance increased overall as a function of repetition number ($b = 0.184, ~t = 12.801, ~p < $)

% We found that communicative efficiency increased overall between the \textit{pre} and \textit{post} phases ($b = 1.45,~t = 14.3,~p <0.001$), reflecting generalized improvements as a consequence of extended interaction.
% Critically, this analysis also revealed a reliable interaction between phase and condition: communicative efficiency improved to a greater extent for repeated objects than control objects ($b = 0.648, ~t = 3.09,~p = 0.003$; see Figure \ref{refgame_bis}). 

We found a significant difference in recognizability: while there was some improvement across repetitions in the shuffled condition, likely attributable to a practice effect, they achieved significantly worse performance than participants in the yoked condition who saw the same sketches in their original context. 


\subsubsection{Viewer feedback also contributes to gains in performance}

Because participants in the yoked group viewed drawings in exactly the same sequence as the original viewer had, we predicted that their recognition performance would improve substantially across repetitions. 
However, unlike viewers in the communication game, these participants were unable to provide feedback to the sketcher, who could have used information about which object the viewer had selected and how quickly they were able to select it, in order to modify their sketches on subsequent repetitions. 
Instead, these participants made their decision based only on the final drawing, and were unable to interrupt or await additional information from the sketcher if they were still uncertain.
As such, this control experiment provided an estimate of how much of the performance gains observed in the communication experiment could be attributable to the availability of these social feedback channels.

We compared the communication and yoked groups by measuring changes in task performance on repeated objects using the same efficiency metric as we had previously. 
We estimated the magnitude of these changes by fitting a linear mixed-effects model that included group (i.e., communication vs. shuffled), repetition (i.e., 1st through 8th), and their interaction as fixed effects, and maximal random effects structure, with random intercepts, slopes and interactions between group and repetition for each unique trial sequence. 

This analysis revealed a strong positive effect of repetition ($b = 0.231, ~t = 12.8,~p < 1x10^{-15}$; see Figure \ref{recog_bis}), and a weaker but reliable interaction with group membership ($b = -0.051, ~t = -2.178, ~p = 0.032$), showing that the yoked group improved nearly at the same rate as viewers in the communication experiment had, even in the absence of social feedback. 

However, we also found that the yoked group was less accurate overall at identifying the target object (communication: 87.5\%, yoked: 0.688, $b = -0.156$)

\section{Part III: How do visual features of sketches change over the course of an interaction?}

These control experiments establish that shared history with a particular sketcher is critical for the sketches to remain meaningful late in the game. 
But what is happening over time to the visual features of the sketches themselves? 
In this final section, we conduct finer-grained analyses of the dynamics of graphical representations across communication.


% First, replicating prior findings, we observed that the number of strokes used in each sketches decreased across repetitions, such that later sketches were systematically sparser than earlier ones (XXX; $p<.001$).

\subsection{Analysis methods}


To analyze how the content of the sketches change over time, we extracted the high-level perceptual features of the drawings using a pre-trained convolutional neural network. 
Each sketch produced in our reference game data set was thus projected to a common 4,096-dimensional feature space given by the \texttt{fc6} layer of VGG. 

Sketch features at this layer have been shown in prior work to match the representational space of images better than at lower layers of the network \cite{FanCommon2018} and have been successful more broadly in predicting neural responses in high-level visual cortex \cite{yamins2014performance}.
In this space, we compute the similarity between any two sketches as the \emph{correlation} between their feature vectors.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Sketches simplify across repetitions}

First we considered an even simpler feature , we observed that the number of strokes used in each sketch decreased across repetitions, such that later sketches were systematically sparser than earlier ones (XXX; $p < .001$). 

The decrease in the number  over time motivates an investigation for analyzing which part of a sketch for a particular target stays consistent across successive repetitions. 
Here, stroke lesions are used to provide a visualization of stroke importance of a sketch with respect to its successive sketch. 
We measure the importance of a stroke by computing the similarity between a sketch with the stroke 
The color of a stroke in a sketch corresponds to the similarity of the sketch to its successor when removing that stroke from the sketch. 
In other words, for each stroke, we measured how similar the sketch without the stroke is to its successor.

\subsubsection{Sketches  away from the initial round}

\subsubsection{Sketchers draw the same object increasingly consistently}

In addition to sketches drawn by different sketchers growing increasingly dissimilar, we predicted that sketches would become increasingly internally consistent \emph{within} games. 
In other words, while there may be major revisions or simplifications of sketches in early rounds, sketchers may then settle into stable conventions.
We examined this prediction by computing the pairwise similarity of sketches drawn on successive rounds of the same target object by the same sketcher. 

We found that the similarity of successive sketches \emph{increases} strongly over time ($b = 0.53, t = 5.03$; see Figure \ref{within-across}) in a mixed effects regression including linear and quadratic terms as well as random intercepts for both sketcher and target. 
As a baseline, we considered the null distribution of slope $t$ values produced by first scrambling sketches across pair for each repetition and target.
The true effect was significantly greater than this null distribution, $p < .001$, which actually tended in the opposite direction $CI = [-2.45 -1.88]$.  \rdh{TODO: update these vals}

\subsubsection{Different sketchers draw the same object in increasingly different ways} 

The shuffled condition of our control experiments suggested that conventions were \emph{interaction-specific}; we made the further prediction that while early sketches may be more strongly constrained by a shared target image, later sketches may be more \emph{variable} as pairs settle into multiple equilibria.
In other words, the \emph{visual features} of different pairs may diverge from one another over the course of the game.
We tested this prediction by computing the mean pairwise similarity of sketches of each target \emph{across games} on each repetition. 
In a mixed-effects regression including linear and quadratic terms, we found a weak effect of repetition on pairwise sketch similarity ($b = -1.4, t = -2.5$)  after including random slopes and intercepts for targets and game pairs. %and quadratic ($b= 0.42, t = 3.9$)
We conducted a permutation test to non-parametrically compare this observed decrease in similarity with what would be expected from disrupting the temporal structure of our data.
For each pair and target object, we scrambled sketch identifiers across repetitions 1000 times to generate a null distribution of $t$ values $(CI = [-0.57, 0.60])$, under which the observed decrease was highly unlikely, $p < 0.001$.

\subsection{Discussion}

% Summary paragraph
In this paper, we investigated the joint contributions of visual information and social context in determining the meaning of drawings.
We observed in an interactive Pictionary-style communication game that pairs discover increasingly sparse yet effective graphical representations as they repeatedly depict the same objects.
Through a series of control experiments, we demonstrated that these simpler drawings were harder for independent viewers to recognize without sharing the history of interaction with the same sketcher.
Furthermore, by analyzing the high-level visual features of drawings, we found that they became increasingly consistent within an interaction, but that different pairs discovered different solutions for efficient communication, revealing the existence of multiple equilibria in the space of viable graphical conventions. 
Taken together, our findings suggest that repeated visual communication promotes the emergence of depictions whose meanings are increasingly determined by shared knowledge rather than their perceptual properties alone.

% highlighting generative innovations relative to previous work (i.e. we're not just doing reproducing the same thing but with better controls & analyses; we're exploring a different part of the space)
While our results build on previous work in graphical convention formation \cite{garrod_foundations_2007,fay2010interactive}, there are two key innovations in our paradigm. 
First, we used \emph{images} as the targets of reference instead of more verbal concepts like ``art gallery'' or ``Robert de Niro.''  
We expected this choice to initially ground different pairs more strongly in the same visual features and reduce variance across pairs; that we still observed diverging representations across pairs is a stronger testament  to the role of social context.
Furthermore, because both sketches and target objects share the same modality, future work should directly examine the similarity of sketches to the target images to measure the effect of iconicity.
Second, we \dots

Our work also leaves open several hypotheses about \emph{how} people are deciding which strokes to preserve or drop on each trial. 
According to one account, sketchers may be guided a \emph{primacy} bias where they drop out later, detail-providing strokes to preserve their initial strokes.
A second possibility is that they are guided by a \emph{recency} bias: when a particular sketch is successful, they keep the final strokes they put down and drop out earlier ones.
Finally, the temporal structure of sketches may not matter and they could simply be dropping random strokes, or the least informative strokes. 
An important task for future work is to distinguish between these possibilities using lesion analyses like those above, or more fine-grained computational models of sketch generation.
