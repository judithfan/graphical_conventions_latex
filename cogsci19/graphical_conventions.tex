\begin{abstract}
We rely upon widely shared graphical conventions to communicate complex information, ranging from maps to musical notation to modern data visualization. 
How do these abstract graphical representations derive meaning? 
A key hypothesis is that their capacity to be effective carriers of meaning is driven by local patterns of usage and the functional needs of the individuals who use them to communicate. 
Here we investigated the formation of novel graphical conventions across extended visual communication between two people. 
We developed a drawing-based reference game in which two participants repeatedly communicate about visual objects. 
On each trial, both players were shown an array of four objects; the sketcher’s goal was to draw one of these, the target, so that the viewer could guess the target as quickly as possible. 
The game included two sets of objects: objects in one set were drawn repeatedly, while those in a control set were drawn once at the beginning and again at the end of the game. 
Across repetitions, we find that pairs discover increasingly sparse, yet effective and internally consistent ways of depicting them. 
While we observe gains in communication efficiency for all objects, they were greater for the repeated objects, suggesting both task-level and object-level benefits of repeated communication. 
Moreover, different pairs discovered different solutions for efficient communication, revealing the existence of multiple equilibria in the space of graphical conventions. 
Taken together, our findings suggest that repeated visual communication promotes the emergence of depictions whose meanings are increasingly determined by social context rather than their perceptual properties alone.

\section{Introduction}

From ancient etchings on cave walls to modern digital displays, visual communication lies at the heart of key human innovations (e.g., mapmaking, data visualization), and forms the foundation for the cultural transmission of knowledge and higher-level reasoning. 
Perhaps the most basic and versatile technique supporting visual communication is drawing, the earliest examples of which date to at least 40,000-60,000 years ago \cite{hoffmann2018u,Aubert:2014jy}, and which has since been adapted to a broad diversity of applications, spanning photorealistic rendering from observation and schematic diagrams consisting entirely of symbols. 

How does a medium spanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning? 
On the one hand, prior work suggests that semantic information in a figurative drawing, e.g., what it represents, can be derived from its perceptual properties alone \cite{FanCommon2018,sayim2011line}. 
On the other hand, other work has argued that socially-mediated information and context is crucial to make appropriate inferences about even what a figurative drawing means \cite{goodman1976languages,gombrich1969art}.

How can these two perspectives be reconciled? 
Our approach is to consider the hypothesis that both visual information and social context may jointly explain how drawings derive meaning \cite{fan2018modeling}, and that a critical factor affecting the balance between the two may be the degree of shared knowledge between communicators. 
In this paper, we explore the possibility that the accumulation of shared knowledge via extended visual communication may promote the development of increasingly schematic and effective ways of depicting a physical object, even if these even if these \textit{ad hoc} graphical conventions are less readily apprehended by others who lack this shared knowledge. 

% simple, consistent, and effective ways to depict something, even if these \textit{ad hoc} graphical conventions are less readily apprehended by others. 

To investigate this, we used an online drawing-based reference game in which two players repeatedly communicate about visual objects. 
On each trial, both players were shown an array of four objects; the sketcher’s goal was to draw one of these, the target, so that the viewer could guess the target as quickly as possible. 
The game included two sets of objects: objects in one set were drawn repeatedly, while those in a control set were drawn once at the beginning and again at the end of the game. 
Across repetitions, we find that pairs discover increasingly sparse, consistent, and effective ways of depicting them. 
While we observe gains in communication efficiency for all objects, they were greater for the repeated objects, suggesting both task-level and object-level benefits of repeated communication. 


Critically, viewers who had to recognize sketches sampled from different interactions did not learn

Taken together, our findings suggest that repeated visual communication promotes the emergence of depictions whose meanings are increasingly determined by shared knowledge rather than their perceptual properties alone.

% \red{What prior work has been done to understand them?}
This notion is resonant with prior studies employing visual communication tasks that have found that pairs of interacting participants can rapidly learn to produce drawings that are referentially meaningful to their partner in context, even when these drawings do not strongly resemble any particular real-world referent out of context \cite{garrod_foundations_2007,fay2010interactive,Galantucci:2005uh,healey2007graphical}.

\section{Part I: How does repeated reference support successful visual communication?}

%% intro to this section
\rdh{eventually need to compress these methods quite a bit (participants can be 1 sentence, much less detail about stim selection and procedure, etc.)} 

To investigate the formation of \textit{ad hoc} graphical conventions in a naturalistic setting, we developed a visual communication task in which people repeatedly referred to familiar real-world objects, but where pre-existing graphical conventions were unlikely to be sufficient to succeed. 
In line with prior studies of repeated verbal communication \cite<e.g>{ClarkWilkesGibbs86_ReferringCollaborative} and visual communication about verbal stimuli \shortcite<e.g.>{garrod_foundations_2007}, we hypothesized that repeated visual reference to a visual object would lead to more efficient communication about that object.
Departing from prior studies, our experiment critically includes a control set of visual objects that are not repeatedly referenced, which allows us to measure the extent to which changes in efficiency are item-specific or attributable to task practice.

\subsection{Methods: Visual Communication Experiment}

\subsubsection{Participants} A total of 138 unique participants (verify), who were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and grouped into pairs, completed the experiment.
They were provided a base compensation of \$1.50 for participation and earned up to \$0.04 bonus for each correct trial, inversely proportional to the amount of time taken. 
\red{what was exclusion criteria? -- definition of crazy in df generation helpers?}
Data from two pairs were excluded due to unusually low performance on the task (i.e., proportion correct $<$3 s.d. below the mean).
In this and subsequent behavioral experiments, participants provided informed consent in accordance with the Stanford IRB.\footnote{All materials and data are available at \url{https://github.com/cogtoolslab/graphical_conventions}.}

\subsubsection{Stimuli} 
%% provide justification for why we're using sets of similar objects
%% provide justification for why we're using images of real-world objects

Our approach was to define sets of perceptually similar real-world objects belonging to the same basic-level category \cite{MervisRosch81_CategorizationReview}.
To accomplish this, we utilize the collection of chair objects in the ShapeNet database \cite{chang2015shapenet}.
This collection contains objects that are geometrically complex, highly diverse, and abundant in the real world.
To identify groups of perceptually similar chairs within the collection, we first extracted high-level visual features of each of the 3,096 object images using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, VGG-19 \cite{simonyan2014very}. 
We then applied principal component analysis and $k$-means clustering to the model's top-layer feature representation of the images. 
This yielded 70 clusters containing between 2 and 80 objects each (\red{verify}).
Based on the results of this feature extraction and clustering procedure, we defined two categories of perceptually similar objects containing eight exemplars each (Fig.~\ref{fig:1a}). 

% In order to identify groups of objects that are drawn similarly prior to training, we applied a clustering algorithm (affinity propagation with damping = 0.9; \cite{frey2007clustering}) to the model's top-layer feature representation of drawings from the same dataset analyzed above \cite{Eitz:2012dk}. This yielded 16 clusters containing between 3 and 20 objects each. Among clusters containing at least 8 objects, we defined 8 ``visual categories'' containing 8 objects each (Table \ref{cluster_obj_list}). Each participant was randomly assigned two of these categories, and only the 16 objects from these two categories appeared as drawing targets during their session.

\subsubsection{Procedure} 

%% Trial-level event structure

Drawings were collected in the context of an online, sketching-based reference game using the framework described in \citeA{Hawkins15_RealTimeWebExperiments}. 
The game involved two players: a \textit{sketcher} who aims to help a \textit{viewer} pick out a target object from a set of distractor objects by representing it in a sketch. 
On each trial, both participants were shown the same array of four objects; however, the positions of these objects were randomized for each participant. 
One of the four objects was highlighted on the sketcher's screen to designate it as the target.

%% Trial-level objective of sketcher and viewer
Sketchers drew using black ink on digital canvas (pen width = 5 pixels; 300 $\times$ 300 pixels) embedded in a web browser window. 
Participants drew using the mouse cursor, and were not able to delete previous strokes. Each stroke was rendered on the viewer's screen immediately upon the completion of each stroke. 
The sketcher was instructed to take no longer than 30 seconds to produce their drawings. 
The viewer was allowed guess the identity of the drawn object by clicking one of the four objects in the array even when the sketcher had not completed the drawing. 
Both participants received immediate task-related feedback: the sketcher learned when and which object the viewer had clicked, and the viewer learned the true identity of the target. 
Otherwise, the viewer had no other means of communicating with the sketcher. 
Both participants earned accuracy bonus points for each correct response. 
If the correct response was made under the 30-second time limit, they also received speed bonus points inversely proportional to the time taken until the response.

%% Two conditions: repeated and control

% Each pair of participants was randomly assigned two of these categories, and only the 16 objects from these two categories appeared as drawing targets during their session.

Each pair of participants was randomly assigned two sets of four objects: one set was was assigned to the repeated condition; the other to the control condition.
In order to explore the degree to which the effects of repeated communication were object-specific, we varied the perceptual similarity between the two sets across pairs. 
Specifically, in half of the pairs (N=XX pairs), one set contained four randomly sampled objects from one category and the second set contained the remaining four objects from the same category. 
In the other half of pairs (N=XX pairs), one set contained four randomly sampled objects from one category and the second set contained four randomly sampled objects from the other category.
The assignment of each set to the repeated and control conditions was randomized across pairs. 

The communication task consisted of three phases. 
During the \textit{repeated} phase, the sketcher drew the four repeated objects six times each, in an interleaved order.
Specifically, there were six repetition epochs wherein each object in the repeated set served as the target exactly once, and object order was randomized across repetition cycles. 
Before and after the \textit{repeated} phase, the sketcher drew all eight objects one time each, again in randomly interleaved order. 
Including the control condition in this pre-post design allowed us to assess the specificity of repetition effects: control objects from the same category were maximally perceptually similar to the repeated objects but were not repeatedly drawn, and control objects from the other object category provided a measure of the generic effects of production task practice. 

\subsection{Result: conventions are efficient and item-specific}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/refgame_BIS_timeseries.pdf}
\caption{Communication efficiency for repeated and control objects across repetitions. Efficiency was computed using a metric that combines both speed and accuracy, and is plotted relative to performance on the first repetition.} \label{refgame_bis}
\end{figure}

We operationalized communicative efficiency using a composite behavioral measure that accounts for both accuracy (proportion of successful listener responses) and speed (time elapsed during each drawing).
More specifically, we normalize both accuracy and drawing duration within each game and take the difference between these scores \cite<the \emph{balanced integration score,}>{Liesefeld2018}.
To compare the effect of repetition across the control and repeated conditions, we conducted a mixed-effects regression including a maximum random effect structure with random intercepts, slopes, and interactions for each pair of participants and each target object. 
While pairs became increasingly efficient between the pre-test and post-test for both control and repeated objects, we found a significant interaction: sketches of repeated targets showed a greater increase in efficiency than the control targets which were shown only at the beginning and end of the task ($b = 0.68, ~t = 3.4,~p = 0.001$; see Figure \ref{refgame_bis}). 
%This ensures that the reduction in the drawing duration and number of strokes over time is not due to the players losing interest or becoming less motivated during the game. 
We find a similar effect when we examine number of strokes per sketch instead of drawing duration. 
Thus, participants converged on simpler, faster, and more communicatively successful graphical conventions for repeated objects, which only partially transferred to other objects.
%We clearly see that while the cost of sketching decreases, the accuracy of the viewer's guess of which object the sketch is referring to increases, suggesting that this reduction is meaningful.

%Successful communication was primarily quantified as the viewer's accuracy in identifying the target. 
%The investment of time was measured as the length of time between the beginning of the first stroke to the completion of the final stroke in each sketch, and the investment of ink was measured in two ways: as the number of strokes used for each sketch and the proportion of the drawing canvas filled by ink.

\section{Part II: What explains gains in communication efficiency?}

\rdh{The other point of this experiment is to test the 'drift toward the arbitrary' (but not in those words...) i.e. we predict that  need to set that up a bit, too.}

While our reference game experiment established that participants coordinate on increasingly efficient and item-specific conventions, we also hypothesized that these conventions would be \emph{interaction}-specific: that later sketches would be less recognizable without the (idiosyncratic) history of the interaction.
To rigorously distinguish this hypothesis from alternatives, we designed a recognition task where an independent group of participants were presented with the sketches from our interactive reference game and asked to pick the target out of a lineup.
This allows us to manipulate the sequence of trials.
\rdh{Say something briefly about the alternative hypotheses}

\subsection{Methods: Recognition Experiment}

\subsubsection{Participants}

\rdh{TODO}

\subsubsection{Design}

%How does efficiency of graphical communication, measured by how accurately and quickly the viewer can select the target intended by the sketcher, change when we change the degree of interaction specificity? 
%Here, we define interaction specificity based on both temporal structure (path dependence) and partner specificity. 
%Therefore, we design several experiments that measure the recognizability of drawings and reaction times produced in the drawing task by third-party observers. 
The stimuli and procedure were constructed to carefully match the experience of Viewers in the reference game.
Participants had access to the same four-object context shown on the corresponding trial of the original reference game and were similarly asked to select which object they thought the drawing referred to. 
They were also given the same bonus incentives for accuracy and speed. \rdh{double-check this}.

We constructed the 40 trial sequence of sketches according to two schemes.
In a `yoked' condition, participants were matched with a pair from the reference game dataset and saw sketches in the same order they were originally produced. 
In a `shuffled' condition, we presented sketches on the same \emph{trial} that they were originally drawn but instead of all sketches being drawn from the same game, we mixed together sketches from different games.
Concretely, each block of 4 trials (one for each target in context) were sampled from a random game.
Thus, we preserved the temporal structure of sketches but disrupted the continuity of the interaction.

% More about method design:
% Yoked
%Just as in the communication task, 

\subsection{Result: yoked similar to reference game}

The only difference was the inability to give feedback to the Sketcher.
%Thus, if the Sketcher does not know which object the third-party viewer had guessed on each trial. 

\subsection{Result: conventions are interaction-specific}

Next, we compared the yoked condition against the scrambled condition using a mixed-effects model.
We found a significant difference in recognizability: while there was some improvement across repetitions in the shuffled condition, likely attributable to a practice effect, they achieved significantly worse performance than participants in the yoked condition who saw the same sketches in their original context.

\end{figure}

\section{Part III: How do visual features of sketches change across repetitions?}

To analyze how the content of the sketches change over time, we extracted the high-level perceptual features of the drawings using a pre-trained convolutional neural network. 
Sketch features taken from the \textit{fc6} layer of VGG have been shown in prior work to match the representational space of images better than at lower layers of the network \cite{Fan18}. 
In addition, features extracted from \emph{fc6} have been successful in predicting neural responses in high-level visual cortex \cite{Yamins}.
We therefore define the similarity between two sketches as the correlation between their feature vectors.
