\begin{abstract}
Drawing is a versatile technique for visual communication, ranging from photorealistic renderings to schematic diagrams consisting entirely of symbols.
How does a medium spanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning?
A natural possibility is that drawings derive meaning from both their visual properties as well as shared knowledge between people who use them to communicate.
Here we evaluate this possibility in a drawing-based reference game in which two participants repeatedly communicated about visual objects.
Across a series of controlled experiments, we found that pairs of participants discover increasingly sparse yet effective ways of depicting objects.
These gains were specific to those objects that were repeatedly referenced, and went beyond what could be explained by task practice or the visual properties of the drawings alone.
We employed modern techniques from computer vision to characterize how the high-level visual features of drawings changed, finding that drawings of the same object became more consistent within a pair of participants and divergent across participants from different interactions.
Taken together, these findings suggest that visual communication promotes the emergence of depictions whose meanings are increasingly determined by shared knowledge rather than their visual properties alone.

\section{Introduction}

From ancient etchings on cave walls to modern digital displays, visual communication lies at the heart of key human innovations (e.g., cartography, data visualization) and forms a durable foundation for the cultural transmission of knowledge and higher-level reasoning.
Perhaps the most basic and versatile technique supporting visual communication is drawing, the earliest examples of which date to at least 40,000-60,000 years ago \cite{hoffmann2018u}.
What began as simple mark making has since been adapted to a wide array of applications, ranging from photorealistic rendering to schematic diagrams consisting entirely of symbols.

Even in the relatively straightforward case of drawing from life, there are countless ways to depict the same object.
How does a communication medium spanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning?
On the one hand, prior work has found that semantic information in a figurative drawing, i.e., the object it represents, can be derived purely from its visual properties \cite{FanCommon2018}.
On the other hand, other work has emphasized the role of socially-mediated information for making appropriate inferences about what even a figurative drawing represents \cite{goodman1976languages}.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Repeated visual communication depicting the same object.}
\label{sketch_gallery}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

How can these two perspectives be reconciled?
Our approach is to consider the joint contributions of visual information and social context in determining how drawings derive meaning \cite{abell2009canny}, and to propose that a critical factor affecting the balance between the two may be the amount of shared knowledge between communicators.
Specifically, we explore the hypothesis that accumulation of shared knowledge via extended visual communication may promote the development of increasingly schematic yet effective ways of depicting an object, even as these \textit{ad hoc} graphical conventions may be less readily apprehended by others who lack this shared knowledge.

To investigate this hypothesis, we used an interactive Pictionary game where two participants repeatedly communicated about visual objects.
We examined both how their task performance and the drawings they produced changed over time as they accumulated shared knowledge (see Fig.~\ref{sketch_gallery}).
This approach was inspired by a large literature that has explored how extended interaction influences communicative behavior in several modalities, including language \cite{ClarkWilkesGibbs86_ReferringCollaborative,hawkins2020characterizing}, gesture \cite{goldin1996silence}, and drawings \cite{garrod_foundations_2007,galantucci2005experimental}.
There are three aspects of the current work that advance our prior understanding: \emph{first}, we include a control set of objects that were not repeatedly drawn but only shown at the beginning and end of the interaction, allowing us to measure the specific contribution of repeated reference vs. general practice effects; \emph{second}, we measure how strongly the visual properties of drawings drive recognition in the absence of interaction history for naive viewers, while equating other task variables; and \emph{third}, we employ recent advances in computer vision to quantitatively characterize changes in the high-level visual properties of drawings across repetitions.

%% intro to this section
To understand how people learn to communicate about visual objects across repeated visual communication, we developed a drawing-based reference game for two participants.
On each trial, both participants shared a \textit{communicative context}, represented by an array of four objects drawn from a cluster of visually similar 2D renderings of chairs (Fig.~\ref{task_stimuli}A).
One of these objects was privately designated as the \emph{target} for the sketcher.
The sketcher's goal was to draw the target so that the viewer could select it from the array of distractor objects as quickly and accurately as possible.
Importantly, sketchers drew the same objects multiple times over the course of the experiment, receiving feedback about the viewer's response after each trial  (Fig.~\ref{task_stimuli}C).
This \emph{repeated reference game} design thus allows us to track changes in both the overall task performance of the dyad as well as changes in the content of the drawings.

\subsection{Participants learn to communicate more effectively}

Do participants learn to communicate more effectively over the course of interaction?
On the first trial, viewers identified the target at rates well above chance (76\%, chance = 25\%), suggesting that they were engaged with the task but not yet at ceiling performance.
In order to measure how well pairs learned to communicate throughout the rest of their interaction, we used a measure of communicative efficiency \cite<the \emph{balanced integration score,}>{Liesefeld2018} that takes both accuracy (i.e., proportion of correct viewer responses) and response time (i.e., latency before viewer response) into account.
This efficiency score is computed by first $z$-scoring accuracy and response time for each drawing within an interaction, in order to map different interactions onto the same scale.
We then combine these measures by subtracting the standardized response time from standardized accuracy.
Efficiency is highest when pairs are both fast and accurate, and lowest when they make more errors and take longer, relative to their own performance on other trials.
We found that communication efficiency significantly improves across repeatedly drawing the same target object, $b=0.5,~t=13.5,~p<0.001$; Fig.~\ref{refgame_bis}.
Similar results were found when examining only response times, $b=-1.5,~t=-11.5,~p<0.001$, or accuracy, $b=0.65,~z=6.2,~p < 0.001$, reflecting independent contributions of each component of efficiency.
A straightforward explanation for these gains is that sketchers were able to use fewer strokes per drawing to achieve the same level of viewer recognition accuracy.
Indeed, we found that the number of strokes in drawings of repeated objects decreased steadily as a function of repetition ($b = -0.216, ~t = -6.00$; Fig.~\ref{within-across}A). 
Overall, these results suggest that pairs were increasingly able to rely upon shared knowledge to communicate more efficiently.

%\subsubsection{Increasing dissimilarity from initial drawing}
%
%Mirroring the observed reduction in the number of strokes across repetitions, we hypothesized that there was also cumulative change in the visual content of drawings across repetitions.
%Concretely, we predicted that drawings would become increasingly dissimilar from the initial depiction.
%We tested this prediction in a mixed-effects regression model including linear and quadratic terms for repetition as well as intercepts for each target and pair.
%We found a significant decrease in similarity to the initial round across successive repetitions, $(b = -0.62,~t = -5.59$; Fig.~\ref{within-across}C), suggesting that later drawings had moved to a different region of visual feature space.
%However, since the entire distribution of drawings may have drifted to a different region of the visual feature space for generic reasons (i.e., because they were sparser overall), we conducted a stricter permutation test.
%We scrambled drawings across pairs but within each repetition and target and re-ran our mixed-effects model.
%The observed effect fell outside this null distribution $(CI= [-3.53 -0.88], ~p < .001)$, showing that successive drawings by the same sketcher deviated from their own initial drawing to a greater degree than would be expected due to generic differences between drawings made at different timepoints in an interaction.

%\ndg{optionally: add the observation that the object-general boost seems to be achieved after the first trial, and is likely very general orientation to the task?}

% the benefits of repeatedly communicating about an object accrue more strongly to that object
% show gains in communicative efficiency are to some extent specific to the objects that were repeatedly referenced

% Optional: We found a similar pattern of results when we used the number of strokes in each drawing instead of drawing time in our estimate of communicative efficiency.

% Thus, participants converged on simpler, faster, and more communicatively successful graphical conventions for repeated objects, which only partially transferred to other objects.

%We clearly see that while the cost of sketching decreases, the accuracy of the viewer's guess of which object the drawing is referring to increases, suggesting that this reduction is meaningful.

%% task-level and object-level benefits of extended communication.

%Successful communication was primarily quantified as the viewer's accuracy in identifying the target.
%The investment of time was measured as the length of time between the beginning of the first stroke to the completion of the final stroke in each sketch, and the investment of ink was measured in two ways: as the number of strokes used for each drawing and the proportion of the drawing canvas filled by ink.

%This ensures that the reduction in the drawing duration and number of strokes over time is not due to the players losing interest or becoming less motivated during the game.

\subsection{Conventions are object-specific}

Do these improvements in performance reflect convergence on conventional \emph{object-specific} depictions, or more general practice effects of drawing with our interface?
We tested this hypothesis by examining performance in an additional \emph{control} condition including objects that were only drawn once at the beginning (the \emph{pre}-phase) and at the end (the \emph{post}-phase;  Fig.~\ref{task_stimuli}B).
We hypothesized that that over repeated visual reference to a particular object, participants would discover ways of depicting that object more effectively than the non-repeated control objects.
We found no difference in accuracy between conditions during the pre-phase (75.7\% repeated, 76.1\% control, mean difference: 0.3\%, bootstrapped CI: $[-7\%, 7\%]$), as objects were randomly assigned to repeated and control conditions.
To evaluate changes in communicative efficiency, we fit a linear mixed-effects model including random intercepts, slopes, and interactions for each pair of participants.
We found a main effect of increasing communicative efficiency for all targets between the \textit{pre} and \textit{post} phases ($b = 0.72,~t = 14.6,~p <0.001$), reflecting a component of general improvements due to task practice.
Critically, however, we found a reliable interaction between phase and condition: communicative efficiency improved to a greater extent for repeated objects than control objects ($b = -0.16, ~t = -3.17,~p = 0.002$; see Fig.~\ref{refgame_bis}).
Analysis of changes in raw accuracy yielded a similar result: performance on control objects only improved by 7.1\%, less than half of the improvement of 14.5\% for repeated objects.
Together, these data show that there are benefits of repeatedly communicating about an object that accrue specifically to that object, suggesting the formation of object-specific graphical conventions.

An intriguing possibility is that interacting pairs achieved such object-specificity by gradually forming \textit{ad hoc} graphical conventions about what was relevant and sufficient to include in a drawing to support rapid identification of the target object.
We explored this possibility by directly examining how the drawings themselves changed throughout an interaction.
In particular, we measure the similarity between successive drawings of an object from round-to-round to test the extent to which pairs converge on stable, internally consistent ways of depicting objects within an interaction.
Measuring visual similarity between drawings depends upon a principled approach for encoding their high-level visual properties.
Here we capitalize on recent work validating the use of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models to encode such perceptual content in drawings \cite{FanCommon2018}.
Trained DCNN models have been shown to predict human perceptual similarity judgments about objects \cite{kubilius2016deep,peterson2018evaluating}, as well as neural population responses in visual cortex during object recognition \cite{yamins2014performance,gucclu2015deep}.
As such, they provide a principled choice of encoding model for extracting high-level visual information from images.
We extracted the high-level visual features of each sketch using the VGG-19 neural network architecture, and we computed the similarity of successive drawings of the same object made in the same interaction (i.e.~repetition $k$ to $k+1$). 
A mixed-effects model with random intercepts for both object and pair showed that similarity between successive drawings increased substantially throughout an interaction ($b = 0.53,~t = 5.03$; Fig.~\ref{within-across}).
We compared our empirical estimate of the magnitude of this trend to a null distribution of slope $t$ values generated by scrambling drawings across pairs. 
The observed increase fell outside this null distribution ($CI = [-3.21, -0.60], p < .001$), providing evidence that increasingly consistent ways of drawing each object manifested only for series of drawings produced within the same interaction.

\subsection{Conventions are interaction-specific}

Our visual communication experiment established that pairs of participants coordinate on more efficient and \emph{object-specific} ways of depicting targets. % more efficiently across repetitions.
This raises the question: to what extent do these gains in efficiency reflect the accumulation of \emph{interaction-specific} shared knowledge between a sketcher and viewer, as opposed to the combination of task practice and the inherent visual properties of their drawings?
To disentangle the contributions of these different factors, we conducted two additional control experiments to estimate the how recognizable these drawings were to naive viewers outside the social context in which they were produced.
%Naive participants performed a drawing recognition task that closely matched the task of the viewer in
%In these experiments, we manipulated the sequence of drawings shown to naive participants in a recognition task.
Participants in the \emph{yoked} control group were shown a sequence of drawings taken from a single interaction, closely matching the experience of viewers in the communication experiment.
Participants in the \emph{shuffled} control group were instead shown a sequence of drawings pieced together from many different interactions, thus disrupting the continuity experienced by viewers paired with a single sketcher.
Insofar as interaction-specific shared knowledge contributed to the efficiency gains observed previously, we hypothesized that the second group would not improve as much over the course of the experimental session as the first group would.
At the trial level, groups in both conditions thus received exactly the same visual information and performed the task under the same incentives to respond quickly and accurately.
At the repetition level, both groups received exactly the same amount of practice recognizing drawings.
Thus any differences between these groups are attributable to whether drawings came from the same communicative interaction, which would support the accumulation of interaction-specific experience, or from several different interactions, where such accumulation would be minimal.

%We manipulated the sequence of drawings participants saw such that
% with drawings produced in the earlier experiment.% and asked them to that closely matched the viewer's task in the earlier experiment, except here they knew their responses were not being provided as real-time feedback to the sketcher. %they were presented with drawings and guessed which of the four objects it referred to.
%\ndg{there's something missing on this motivation... maybe a hypothesis like "we expect viewer who see the same sequence of referential drawings to do as well, but viewers who see different ones not to? err...}
% , and they made their decision based on the final drawing, rather than being able to interrupt await additional information.

\paragraph{Interaction history contributes to gains in recognition performance}
We compared the yoked and shuffled groups by measuring changes in recognition performance across successive repetitions using the same efficiency metric we previously used.
We estimated the magnitude of these changes by fitting a linear mixed-effects model that included group (yoked vs. shuffled), repetition number (i.e., first through eighth), and their interaction, as well as random intercepts and slopes for each participant.
While we found a significant increase in recognition performance across both groups ($b = 0.18, ~t = 12.8, ~p < 0.001$), %possibly reflecting general practice effects or inherent visual correspondences between drawings and the target object,  %10^{-15}$
%\ndg{the regression reported doesn't show the latter ("inherent...") since it's about difference over trials?}
we also found a large and reliable interaction:
yoked participants improved to a substantially greater degree than shuffled participants ($b = 0.10, ~t = 4.9, ~p<0.001$; Fig.~4).
Examining accuracy alone yielded similar results: the yoked group improved to a greater degree across the session (yoked: +15.8\%, shuffled: +5.6\%).
% was more accurate overall at identifying the target object (yoked: 75\%, shuffled: 69\%, $~t = 3.6, ~p < 0.001$)
Taken together, these results suggest that third-party observers in the yoked condition who viewed drawings from a single interaction were able to take advantage of this continuity to more accurately identify what successive drawings represented.
While observers in the shuffled condition still improved over time, being deprived of this interaction continuity made it relatively more difficult to interpret later drawings.

These results suggest that the graphical conventions discovered by different pairs were increasingly opaque to outside observers.
This effect could arise if early drawings were more strongly constrained by the visual properties of a shared target object, but later drawings diverged as different pairs discovered different equilibria in the space of viable graphical conventions.
Under this account, drawings of the same object from different pairs would become increasingly dissimilar from each other across repetitions.
We again tested this prediction using high-level visual representations of each drawing derived from a deep neural network.
Specifically, we computed the mean pairwise similarity between drawings of the same object within each repetition index, but produced in different interactions.
In other words, we considered all interactions in which a particular object was repeatedly drawn, then computed the average similarity between drawings of that object made by different sketchers at each point in the interaction.
% Averaging this similarity value over all possible pairs of interactions gives us the mean between-interaction similarity for a given object and a given repetition.
In a mixed-effects regression model including linear and quadratic terms, as well as random slopes and intercepts for object and pair, we found a small but reliable negative effect of repetition on between-interaction drawing similarity ($b = -1.4, ~t = -2.5$; Fig.~\ref{within-across}E). %and quadratic ($b= 0.42, t = 3.9$)
We again conducted a permutation test to compare this $t$ value with what would be expected from scrambling sketches across repetitions for each sketcher and target object.
We found that the observed slope was highly unlikely under this distribution $(CI = [-0.57, 0.60],~p~<~0.001)$.

\paragraph{Viewer feedback also contributes to gains in performance}
%Because participants in the yoked group viewed drawings in exactly the same sequence as the original viewer had, we predicted that their recognition performance would improve to a comparable degree across repetitions.
Unlike viewers in the interactive visual communication experiment, participants in the yoked condition made their decision based only on the whole drawing and were unable to interrupt or await additional information if they were still uncertain.
%Instead, yoked participants , and were unable to interrupt or await additional information from the sketcher if they were still uncertain.
Sketchers could have used this feedback to modify their drawings on subsequent repetitions.
%  about which object the viewer had selected and how quickly they were able to select it,
As such, comparing the yoked and original communication groups provides an estimate of the contribution of these viewer feedback channels to gains in performance \cite{schober_understanding_1989}.
In a mixed-effects model with random intercepts, slopes, and interactions for each unique trial sequence, we found a %estimated the magnitude of these changes by fitting a linear mixed-effects model that included group (i.e., communication vs. yoked), repetition (i.e., 1st through 8th), and their interaction as fixed effects, and maximal random effects structure, with random intercepts, slopes and interactions between group and repetition for each unique trial sequence.

 %1x10^{-15}
% When considering recognition accuracy, however, the feedback gap was more substantial.
To better understand this interaction, we further examined changes in the accuracy and response time components of the efficiency score.
We found that while viewers in the communication experiment were more accurate than yoked participants overall (communication: 88\%, yoked: 75\%), %, $t = 6.2, ~p < 0.001$
\emph{improvements} in accuracy over the course of the experiment were similar in both groups (communication: +14.5\%, yoked: +15.8\%).
The interaction instead appeared to be driven by differential reductions in response time between the first and final repetitions (communication: 10.9s to 5.84s; yoked: 4.66s to 3.31s).
These reductions were smaller in the yoked group, given that these participants did not need to wait for each stroke to appear before making a decision, and thus may have already been closer to floor.

\subsection{Measuring diagnosticity in conventionalization}

\todo[inline]{TODO: Include a schematic context w/ diagnosticity map, sketch map, etc.}
%Concretely, we investigated four aspects that would reflect the increasing contribution of interaction-specific shared knowledge:
%\textit{first}, decreasing number of strokes used (i.e., reducing motor cost of each drawing);
%\textit{second}, increasing dissimilarity from the initial drawing produced (i.e., cumulative drift from the starting point);

% These control experiments establish that shared history with a particular sketcher is critical for the drawings to remain meaningful late in the game.
% But what is happening over time to the visual features of the drawings themselves?
% In this final section, we conduct finer-grained analyses of the dynamics of graphical representations across communication.

% First, replicating prior findings, we observed that the number of strokes used in each drawings decreased across repetitions, such that later drawings were systematically sparser than earlier ones (XXX; $p<.001$).

%% To analyze how the content of the sketches change over time, we extracted the high-level visual features of the drawings using a pre-trained convolutional neural network.
%% Each sketch produced in our reference game data set was thus projected to a common 4,096-dimensional feature space given by the \texttt{fc6} layer of VGG.

Our results so far show that repeated visual communication establishes object-specific, interaction-specific ways of depicting objects.
In other words, sketchers are able to use shared history with their partner to coordinate on sparse, conventional representations.
These results raise a further question about exactly \emph{which} strokes are preserved across successive repetitions during the formation of these conventions.
Rather than randomly dropping strokes, we hypothesized that sketchers would preserve \emph{more diagnostic} information about the object.
For example, in the context shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:diagnosticity_schema}, the target chair has roughly similar legs compared to the distractors, but differs primarily in its unique armrests.
While a convention of referring to this chair by only drawing parts of its legs is possible in principle, given a long enough history to establish such an understanding, we predict that a convention depicting the armrest is more likely in practice, given contextual pressure on the sketcher to be informative \cite<see>[for a related finding in the linguistic modality]{hawkins2020characterizing}.

To test this hypothesis, we ran an additional variant of our task.
To obtain reliable estimates of diagnosticity in context, we required more data for a particular set of contexts instead of randomly sampling different contexts for each pair of participants.
We thus recruited additional participants to play reference games using a set of two fixed contexts, which were counter-balanced across the \emph{repeated} and \emph{control} conditions. %, with objects in the control condition only shown at the beginning and end of the task.
These additional participants also provided an opportunity to conduct an internal replication to evaluate the robustness of our results.
Rather than allowing the viewer to \emph{interrupt} the sketcher with an early response, we required the sketcher to click a ``done'' button when they were ready to show their drawing the viewer.
This design choice removes useful information about the timing of the viewer's response that the sketcher could use to calibrate their drawings on future rounds, but also controlled for a potential confound in our original design. 
Here, drawing duration is purely a function of the sketcher's independent decisions about what needs to be included in a drawing, whereas in our original design, it was a joint combination of the sketcher's decision and the \emph{viewer's decision threshold} for when to interrupt.
It was possible in the original design that any apparent effects of conventionalization were purely driven by the viewer, with the sketcher simply following a heuristic to continue adding more detail until the viewer made a decision.
Aside from this change, the design was identical to the task described above (see Appendix for replications of our earlier analyses on these new data).

We then recruited independent judges to provide annotations of these drawings. 
One group of judges performed a \emph{sketch-mapping} task, which aligned the strokes of a drawing with regions of the target object (see Fig.~\ref{fig:diagnosticity_schema}).
A second group of judges performed an \emph{object-diagnosticity} task, painting over regions of each target object that differed the most from the distractor objects.
We then combined these ratings to measure changes in diagnosticity as conventions are formed.

\todo[inline]{TODO: Write diagnosticity analysis.}


%In ongoing work, we are using a lesion method to investigate the ``importance'' of each stroke within a drawing for explaining similarity to the next repetition's drawing of that object.
%We re-render the drawing without each stroke and compute the similarity, yielding a heat map across strokes (see Fig.~\ref{within-across}B for an example visualization).
%The more dissimilar the lesioned drawing without a particular stroke is to an intact version of the next repetition's drawing, the more ``important'' we consider that stroke to be.

% \jefan{Original version of this paragraph is nice but needs to be heavily streamlined.}
% As a qualitative first step toward answering this question, we conducted a stroke lesion analysis to visualize the ``importance'' of each stroke in determining its similarity to the next repetition's sketch.
% Specifically, we operationalized importance by re-rendering the drawing without each stroke and computing the feature-based similarity to the next drawing (see Fig. \ref{within-across}D).
% We observed that in the earlier drawing, strokes that seemed to refer to similar object parts as the remaining strokes in the later drawing were most important: lesioning them was the biggest blow to the drawing similarity.

%The color of a stroke in a drawing corresponds to the similarity of the drawing to its successor when removing that stroke from the sketch.


\section{Discussion}

% Summary paragraph
In this paper, we investigated the joint contributions of visual information and social context to determining the meaning of drawings.
We observed in an interactive Pictionary-style communication game that pairs of participants discover increasingly sparse yet effective ways of depicting objects over repeated reference.
Through a series of control experiments, we demonstrated that these conventionalized representations were both object-specific and interaction-specific: drawings were harder for independent viewers to recognize without sharing the same interaction history.
Furthermore, by analyzing the high-level visual features of drawings, we found that they became increasingly consistent within an interaction, but that different pairs discover different equilibria in the space of viable graphical conventions.
Taken together, our findings suggest that repeated visual communication promotes the emergence of depictions whose meanings are increasingly determined by interaction history rather than their visual properties alone.

% highlighting generative innovations relative to previous work
% (i.e. we're not just doing reproducing the same thing but with better controls & analyses; we're exploring a different part of the space)
A key experimental design choice was the use of visual objects as the targets of reference, by contrast with the verbal labels or audio clips used in prior work \cite{GalantucciGarrod11_ExperimentalSemiotics,fay2010interactive}. % both builds on and offers several innovative findings.
%First, it enabled greater exploration of iconicity and abstraction.
% By using visual referents that belonged to the same modality as drawings,
As such, communication between the sketcher and viewer was grounded in the same visual information about the appearance of these objects, encouraging the production of more `iconic' initial drawings that more strongly resembled the target object \cite{verhoef2016iconicity,perlman2015iconicity}.
As their communication became increasingly efficient across repetitions, their drawings became simpler and apparently more `abstract'.
An exciting direction for future work is to develop robust and principled computational measures of the degree of visual correspondence between any drawing and any target object, thereby shedding light on the nature of visual abstraction and iconicity.

A second important design choice was the use of a speed bonus incentivizing participants to complete trials quickly.
What role do such incentives play in the formation of graphical conventions?
Recent computational models of visual communication have found that both how costly a drawing is to produce (i.e., time/ink) and how informative a drawing is in context are critical for explaining the way people spontaneously adjust the level of detail to include in their drawings in one-shot visual communication tasks \cite{fan2019pragmatic}.
The consequences of this intrinsic preference for less costly drawings may be compounded across repetitions, as the accumulation of interaction history allows people to be equally informative with fewer strokes \cite{HawkinsFrankGoodman17_ConventionFormation}.
The magnitude of these intrinsic costs may vary across individuals, however, and the speed bonus made them explicit.

%Although we measured patterns in recognizability and visual similarity between sketches that are consistent with a trajectory of increasing `abstraction' from these initial visual features, future work should directly examine the visual similarity between drawings and their corresponding target images for a more operational measure of changes in iconicity.
%we are able to better control for individual differences in the visualization of an abstract concept, a process that was necessary in prior designs.
%Our results show modestly diverging representations for an object across pairs, regardless of this initial grounding, which is an even stronger testament to the role of social context in drawing production and visual abstraction.

%In addition, our \emph{feedback mechanism} allowed us to investigate the effect of social feedback in a controlled, parametric way. Contrary to the focus of prior work, viewers were able to see the drawing being produced in real-time and interrupt sketching as soon as they made their selection, with both players seeing the selection and correct target at the end of each trial.
%This interruption mechanism provides \emph{more} information than synchronously making a selection after the sketcher decided to stop drawing, but \emph{less} information than allowing viewers to jointly draw on the same canvas.
%Future work should explore experimental variations involving intermediate gradations of feedback to distinguish between the effect of various types of feedback such as temporal (e.g., when the viewer guessed) and performance-based (e.g., whether or not the viewer guessed correctly) in graphical convention formation.

A major open question raised by our work concerns how people decide what information to preserve or discard across repetitions.
One possibility is that successful viewer comprehension is attributed to the most recent strokes produced, leading these to be more strongly preserved.
For example, if the viewer was able to correctly identify the target only after the backrest was drawn, the sketcher may continue to selectively draw this part.
Another possibility is that sketchers preserve what they judge to be the most diagnostic information about the target, regardless of when the viewer made their response.
For example, sketchers may focus on drawing the backrest if it strongly distinguishes the target from distractors in context.
% It may also be the case that these decisions are more strongly guided by the communicative informativity or diagnosticity of each stroke than by their temporal sequence.
%A more complex yet revealing analysis would be examining whether certain semantic parts of a drawing are more diagnostic than others.
 % that relate to the semantic structure of the object, while keeping diagnostic parts intact.
Future work should disentangle these possibilities empirically and via development of computational models of visual communication that can learn from task-related feedback, as well as judge which strokes would be most diagnostic.
%, in combination with the development of computational models of drawing production that account for part-level semantic structure.
%\ndg{this last part is a little too technical and in the weeds for this point in the paper? at any rate its not clear why you need those particular ingredients... perhaps instead say that the importance / lesion analysis is a future direction with applications such as determining which strokes are dropped?}

Visual communication is a powerful vehicle for the cultural transmission of knowledge.
Over time, advancing our knowledge of the cognitive mechanisms underlying the formation of graphical conventions may lead to a deeper understanding of the origins of modern symbolic systems for communication and the design of better visual communication tools.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Repeated reference game experiment}

\todo[inline]{TODO: do we need a dedicated section for our fixed-context variant, or should we work it into here?}

\paragraph{Participants} We recruited 138 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk, who were grouped into 69 pairs to play an interactive communication game \cite{Hawkins15_RealTimeWebExperiments}.
Data from two pairs were excluded due to unusually low performance (i.e., accuracy $<$ 3 s.d. below the mean).
For our diagnosticity analyses, which required higher power to measure the effect of a specific context of distractors, we  recruited an additional XXX participants to fill out a fixed subset of two contexts.
This sample also functioned as an internal replication using a more minimal feedback mechanism.
Participants were provided a base compensation of \$1.50 for participation and were able to earn an additional \$1.60 in bonus pay based on task performance.
In this and subsequent experiments, participants provided informed consent in accordance with the Stanford IRB.

\paragraph{Stimuli}

In order to make our task sufficiently challenging, we sought to construct communicative contexts consisting of objects whose members were both geometrically complex and visually similar.
To accomplish this, we sampled objects from the ShapeNet \cite{chang2015shapenet}, a database containing a large number of 3D mesh models of real-world objects. % belonging to 55 different object classes.
We restricted our search to 3096 objects belonging to the \texttt{chair} class, which is among the most diverse and abundant in ShapeNet.
To identify groups of visually similar chairs, we first extracted high-level visual features from 2D renderings of each object using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture, VGG-19 \cite{simonyan2014very}.
This network had been previously trained to recognize objects in photos from the ImageNet database \cite{deng2009imagenet}, containing 1.2 million natural photographs of 1000 different object classes.
Following previous work that has employed DCNN models to evaluate perceptual similarity \cite{peterson2018evaluating,kubilius2016deep}, for each image we extract a 4096-dimensional feature vector reflecting activations in the second fully-connected layer (i.e., \texttt{fc6}) of VGG-19, a higher layer in the network.
We then applied dimensionality reduction (PCA) and $k$-means clustering on these feature vectors, yielding 70 clusters containing between 2 and 80 objects each.
Among clusters that contained at least eight objects, we manually identified two visual categories containing eight objects each, which roughly correspond to `dining chairs' and `waiting-room chairs'.

\paragraph{Task Procedure}

%% Trial-level event structure
Upon entering the session, one participant was assigned the sketcher role and the other was assigned the viewer role. 
These role assignments remained the same throughout the experiment.
On each trial, both participants were shown the same set of four objects in randomized locations.
One of the four objects was highlighted on the sketcher's screen to designate it as the target.
Sketchers drew using their mouse cursor in black ink on a digital canvas embedded in their web browser ($300 \times 300$ pixels; pen width = 5px).
Each stroke was rendered on the viewer's screen in real time and sketchers could not delete previous strokes.
The viewer aimed to select the true target object from the context of four objects as soon as they were confident of its identity, and both participants received immediate feedback: the sketcher learned when and which object the viewer had clicked, and the viewer learned the true identity of the target.
Participants were incentivized to perform both quickly and accurately.
They both earned an accuracy bonus for each correct response, and the sketcher was required to complete their drawings in 30 seconds or less.
If the viewer responded correctly within this time limit, participants also received a speed bonus inversely proportional to the time taken until the response.
There was only one procedural difference in the internal replication we used for diagnosticity analyses.
Instead of allowing the viewer to interrupt the production of the drawing at any point (as in Pictionary), we required them to wait until the sketcher decided to finish and press a ``Done'' button.
% Each pair of participants was randomly assigned two of these categories, and only the 16 objects from these two categories appeared as drawing targets during their session.

\paragraph{Design}
For each pair of participants, two sets of four objects were randomly sampled to serve as communication contexts: one was designated the \emph{repeated} set while the other served as the \emph{control} set (Fig.~\ref{task_stimuli}B).\footnote{In half of the pairs, the four control objects were from the same stimulus cluster as repeated objects; in the other half, they were from different clusters. The rationale for this was to support investigation of between-cluster generalization in future analyses. In current analyses, we collapse across these groups.} 
Our internal replication restricted the stimuli to two fixed sets of four objects, which were counter-balanced to \emph{repeated} and \emph{control}, instead of randomly sampling sets.
% These control objects were thus maximally perceptually similar to the repeated objects but were not repeatedly drawn and provided a tight baseline for object-specific effects.
%In the other half of pairs (N=XX pairs), the repeated set contained four randomly sampled objects from one category and the control set contained four randomly sampled objects from the other category.
The experiment consisted of three phases (Fig.~\ref{task_stimuli}C).
During the repeated reference phase, there were six repetition blocks of four trials, and each of the four repeated objects appeared as the target once in each repetition block.
In a pretest phase at the beginning of the experiment and a posttest phase at the end, both repeated and control objects appeared once as targets (in their respective contexts) in a randomly interleaved order.
%Within this phase were six repetition cycles wherein each repeated object served as the target exactly once, and object order was randomized across repetition cycles.
% These control objects still shared many perceptual features with the repeated objects, but provided a measure of the more generic effects of task practice.

\subsection{Recognition experiments}

\paragraph{Participants}

We recruited 245 participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
We excluded data from 22 participants who did not meet our inclusion criterion for accurate and consistent response on attention-check trials.

\paragraph{Design \& Procedure}
%How does efficiency of graphical communication, measured by how accurately and quickly the viewer can select the target intended by the sketcher, change when we change the degree of interaction specificity?
%Here, we define interaction specificity based on both temporal structure (path dependence) and partner specificity.
%Therefore, we design several experiments that measure the recognizability of drawings and reaction times produced in the drawing task by third-party observers.

On each trial, participants were presented with a drawing and the same set of four objects that accompanied that drawing in the original visual communication experiment.
They also received the same accuracy and speed bonuses as viewers in the communication experiment.
%Their task was thus the same as the viewer's in the communication experiment, except they knew their responses were not being provided as real-time feedback to the sketcher.
To ensure task engagement, we included five identical attention-check trials that appeared once every eight trials.
Each attention-check trial presented the same set of objects and drawing, which we identified during piloting as the most consistently and accurately recognized by naive participants.
Only participants who responded correctly on at least four out of five of these trials were retained in subsequent analyses.
Each participant was randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a \textit{yoked} group and a \textit{shuffled} group.
Each yoked participant was matched with a single interaction from the original cohort and viewed 40 drawings in the same sequence the original viewer had.
Those in the shuffled group were matched with a random sample of 10 distinct interactions from the original cohort and viewed four drawings from each in turn, which appeared within the same repetition block as they had originally.
For example, if a drawing was produced in the fifth repetition block in the original experiment, then it also appeared in the fifth block for shuffled participants.

\subsection{Model-based analyses of sketch features}

As when identifying clusters of similar object stimuli, we again used VGG-19 to extract 4096-dimensional feature vector representations for drawings of every object, in every repetition, from every interaction.
Using this feature basis, we compute the similarity between any two drawings as the Pearson correlation between their feature vectors (i.e., $s_{ij} =  \nicefrac{cov(\vec{r}_{i}, \vec{r}_{j})}{\sqrt{var(\vec{r}_{i}) \cdot var(\vec{r}_{j})}}$).

\todo[inline]{TODO: fill in more details of feature extraction}


\subsection{Empirical measurement of sketch-object correspondences}

A major challenge that arises when comparing multiple drawings is the \emph{alignment problem.} 
Different drawings of the same object may be made at different scales, or translated with some spatial offset on the canvas.
Additionally, when different drawings depict different partial views of an object, it is not straightforward to determine how exactly strokes in one drawing should map onto strokes in the other.
To address these challenges, we designed a \emph{sketch-mapping} task that allows all drawings in our dataset to be projected into a common space.
This task was implemented with a simple annotation interface.
On one side of the screen, participants were shown a line drawing.
On the other side of the screen, they were shown a paint canvas containing the target object the drawing was intended to depict.
For each stroke in the line drawing, participants were asked to paint over the corresponding region of the target object.
We highlighted one stroke at a time, using a bright green color to visually distinguish it, and participants clicked ``Done" when they were finished making their annotation for that stroke.
Participants were not allowed to proceed to the next stroke until some paint was placed on the canvas.
To provide context, we also showed participants the history of the interaction in which the drawing appeared, so it would be clear, for instance, that an isolated half-circle corresponds to the top of the back rest, given more exhaustive earlier drawings.
They continued through all strokes of the given drawing in this way, and then proceeded to the next drawing, annotating a total of 10 different drawings in a session.
We recruited XXX participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk to perform the annotation task.
We excluded participants who consistently provided low-quality annotations (i.e. participants who made random marks to finish the task as quickly as possible) through a combination of manual examination and response latencies.
We continued to recruit until all YYY sketches in our dataset were annotated at least once. 

\subsection{Empirical measurement of object-diagnostic features}

We recruited XXX participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk to provide diagnosticity maps for each target object, relative to its context.
The task interface was similar to the one we used to elicit sketch-object correspondences.
A target object was displayed on the left side of the screen and a foil was displayed on the right side. 
Participants were instructed to paint over the parts of the target chair that were most distinctive and different from the foil.
We elicited pairwise comparisons instead of showing the full context to reduce confusion about what was meant by ``most different'' (i.e. in a large enough context, every part of an object has some difference from at least one distractor). 
Each participant provided exactly one response for all 16 target objects used in our fixed-context experiment, and we randomly assigned participants to one of 24 possible permutations of the contexts. 
This yielded at least 30 ratings for each pair of chairs, and we aggregated diagnosticity ratings across pairs in post-processing.
%Thus, each session collected responses for only one of the three possible pairwise
